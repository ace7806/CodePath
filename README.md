### Notes

I added a scrolling view to the details Activity page so when the textView (overview paragraph) is overflowing
the user can scroll down and keep reading without being cut off

One of the challenges I faced on this project was getting some nice round corners on the images so it could look nice,
I found it it wasn't that simple since messing with transforms could be messy but  quickly figured I needed some help and 
thankfully I was able to resolve it quickly with an android Guru, it was a nice experience.

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [X] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [X] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [X] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
When trying to fetch the json object off of CodePaths async library more often than not it may give you an internal 500 error
this was pretty confusing to fix but best solution that worked for me was to wipe the data off of my device in AVD manager, after that it worked perfectly
